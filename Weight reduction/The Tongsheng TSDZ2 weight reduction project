I want to start a new project to reduce the weight of the Tongsheng TSDZ2. Now it's described on my website but everything can be moved to GitHub.

Building a lightweight ebike with the Tongsheng TSDZ2
E-bikes with mid-drive motors require special frames and those frames are never particularly lightweight. However, any standard lightweight frame can be used for the Tongsheng TSDZ2 motor. Unfortunately, the Tongsheng TSDZ2 is very heavy, if the weight is reduced as described here a very lightweight ebike can be built.

Tongsheng TSDZ2 weight reduction from 3.8kg to 2.6kg
A disadvantage of the Tongsheng TSDZ2 is that it is not built lightweight at all, it weighs 3.8kg (without crank arms, cabling and display). This is much too heavy for making a lightweight ebike. For my Maxun One solar bike, I really need a lightweight mid-drive motor under 3kg. For an example of a such a mid-drive motor: the Shimano Steps E8000 weighs 2.9kg, it's one of the lightest of its kind.

I found out however that the weight of the Tongsheng TSDZ2 can be drastically reduced. To give an example of the unnecessary weight of some parts:

The motor support is made of a solid aluminum block. This can also be made of plastic or it can perhaps be omitted entirely.
The chainring guard is also made of aluminum. This part can simply be omitted or replaced with a lightweight plastic version. 
To investigate which parts can be reduced in weight, I have taken the motor apart and measured the weight of each part.....................
